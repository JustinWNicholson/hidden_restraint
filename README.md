What effect does an alliance with a militarily strong state have on the risk of protege-initiated conflict? Asymmetric alliances, where a powerful, often nuclear-armed, state commits to the defense of a weaker protege state, are thought to encourage revisionism against third parties. The leading explanation for this is moral hazard. However, in contrast to this literature, I argue that adverse selection, driven by uncertainty over patron preferences at the time of alliance formation, drives both the pattern of conflict initiation observed in the literature and significant restraint by proteges in alliances. To test this theory, I build a formal model of asymmetric alliance formation and coercive bargaining and then test the theory using a strategic model of alliance formation that allows for adverse selection into alliance arrangements. I find that alliances are restraining in nature once I control for the adverse selection problem.
